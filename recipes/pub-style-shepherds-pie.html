      <li>Garlic Powder, 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Flour, 1 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Beef Stock Concentrate, 1 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Sour Cream, 2 Tbsp</li>
      <li>White Cheddar Cheese, 1/2 cup</li>

      <li>Carrot, 3 oz</li>
      <li>Yellow Onion, 1</li>
      <li>Yukon Gold Potatoes, 12 oz</li>
      <li>Ground Beef, 10 oz</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat broiler to high. Wash and dry produce. Dice potatoes into 1/2-inch
        pieces. Trim, peel, and halve carrot lengthwise; slice crosswise into
        1/4-inch-thick half-moons. Finely dice celery. Halve, peel, and finely
        chop onion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place potatoes in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2
        inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. Drain and
        return potatoes to pot. Mash with sour cream and 2 Tbsp butter until
        smooth and creamy, adding splashes of water as needed. Season generously
        with salt and pepper. Keep covered off heat until ready to serve.
      </li>
      <li>
        While potatoes cook, heat a drizzle of oil in a medium, preferably
        ovenproof, pan over medium-high heat. Add carrot; season with salt and
        pepper. Cook, stirring, until slightly softened, 2-3 minutes. Add
        celery, onion, and a large drizzle of oil; season with salt and pepper.
        Cook, stirring, until veggies are just tender, 5-7 minutes. TIP: If
        veggies begin to brown too quickly, add a splash of water. Stir in
        garlic powder and thyme. Cook until fragrant, 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beef to pan with veggies; season with salt and pepper. Cook,
        breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6
        minutes. Add tomato paste and flour; cook, stirring, until thoroughly
        combined, 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually pour 1/2 cup water into pan with beef mixture. Stir in stock
        concentrates and bring to a boil. Cook until mixture is very thick, 1-2
        minutes. Turn off heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper. TIP: If
        your pan isn't ovenproof, transfer mixture now to a baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top beef filling with an even layer of mashed potatoes, leaving a gap
        around edge of pan. Evenly sprinkle with cheddar. Broil until browned,
        3-4 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid burning. Serve directly from
        pan.
