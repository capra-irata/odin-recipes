    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Lemon, 1</li>
      <li>Panko Breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup</li>
      <li>Mozzarella Cheese, 1/2 cup</li>
      <li>Italian Seasoning, 1 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Chicken Cutlets, 10 oz</li>
      <li>Sour Cream, 2 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Carrots, 12 oz</li>
      <li>Israeli Couscous, 2.5 oz</li>
      <li>Chicken Stock Concentrate, 1 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Chili Flakes, 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Olive Oil, 4 tsp</li>
      <li>Butter, 2 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and
        dry produce. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into
        1/2-inch-thick pieces. Zest and quarter lemon.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a medium bowl, combine panko, mozzarella, 1 tsp Italian Seasoning, 1
        TBSP olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss carrots on one side of a baking
        sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of chili
        flakes to taste. Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you'll add the chicken
        to the baking sheet then).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat chicken dry with paper towels; season all over with salt and pepper.
        Evenly spread sour cream onto tops of chicken, then mound with panko
        mixture, pressing firmly to adhere (no need to coat the undersides).
      </li>
      <li>
        Once carrots have roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven and
        carefully place chicken on empty side. Roast on top rack until chicken
        is golden brown and cooked through and carrots are browned and tender,
        15-20 minutes. TIP: If carrots are done before chicken, remove from oven
        and continue roasting chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        While carrots and chicken roast, melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over
        medium-high heat. Add couscous and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring,
        until toasted, 2-3 minutes. Add 3/4 cup water and stock concentrate.
        Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until
        couscous is tender, 6-8 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain any excess liquid
        if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once chicken is done, stir 1 TBSP butter into couscous until melted.
        Stir in lemon zest and lemon juice to taste; season with salt and
        pepper. Divide couscous, chicken, and carrots between plates. Serve with
        any remaining lemon wedges on the side.
