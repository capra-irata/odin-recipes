    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Zucchini, 1</li>
      <li>Yellow Onion, 1</li>
      <li>Roma Tomato, 1</li>
      <li>Penne Pasta, 6 oz</li>
      <li>Marinara Sauce, 14 oz</li>
      <li>Italian Seasoning, 1 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Ricotta Cheese, 1 oz</li>
      <li>Mozzarella Cheese, 1/2 cup</li>
      <li>Chili Flakes, 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Olive Oil, 2 tsp</li>
      <li>Sugar, 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Butter, 1 Tbsp</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bring a
        medium pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce. Halve, peel,
        and dice half the onion. Finely dice tomato. Trim zucchini, then grate
        on the largest holes of a box grater.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once water is boiling, add penne to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally,
        until almost al dente, 8 minutes (it'll finish cooking in step 6). Drain
        penne. (Keep empty pot handy for step 5.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high
        heat. Add diced onion, tomato, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring
        occasionally, until onion is softened, 4-6 minutes. â€¢ Stir in marinara,
        zucchini, 1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning, 1/4 cup water, 1 tsp sugar, and a
        big pinch of salt. (You'll use more Italian Seasoning in the next step.)
        Bring to a simmer; cook, stirring, 3 minutes more. Turn off heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        While sauce simmers, in a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 tsp Italian
        Seasoning, and a drizzle of olive oil. (Use the rest of the Italian
        Seasoning as you like.) Season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add drained penne, sauce, and 1 TBSP butter to pot used for pasta.
        Season with salt and pepper; stir to thoroughly combine. Spread out half
        the pasta mixture in an 8-by-8-inch baking dish. Using a tablespoon,
        dollop pasta mixture with herbed ricotta. Top with remaining pasta
        mixture, then sprinkle with mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover baking dish with foil. (TIP: Coat inside of foil with nonstick
        spray first to prevent sticking.) Bake pasta on top rack for 10 minutes,
        then remove from oven; discard foil. Heat broiler to high. Broil until
        cheese is lightly browned, 4-5 minutes. TIP: Watch carefully to avoid
        burning. Let cool slightly; top with chili flakes if desired. Divide
        between plates and serve.
