# odin-recipes

Goal: Create a simple recipe website.

Demonstrate knowledge of anchor, image, list, heading, paragraph, strong,
and emphasis elements.

Demonstrate knowledge of basic git workflow.

Lessons Learned: Break down commits into smaller, more specific chunks.
Mistakenly used "git add ." for a few commits. Files that were irrelevant to
the content of the commit message (such as files that got small formatting
changes or descriptions added) ended up being included.

Use a formatter to be much more efficient with time and consistent with
formatting style.
